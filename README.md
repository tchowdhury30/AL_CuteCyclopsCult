#### ALTester 
- Populates an ArrayList of random integers from 0 to 100
- Iterates through ArrayList checking to see if the element to the right is greater than the element itself; if it is greater, it's unsorted

#### OrderedArrayList
- Overloaded constructor iterates through ArrayList and iterates through every element of the Arrays in ArrayList and checks if the element to the right is greater, and if it is, then the elements switch indices. 
- Add iterates through the Array until each element to the right is greater than newVal. Then use the add method included within ArrayList. If the newVal is greater than all the elements then add newVal to the end.
